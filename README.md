# BSplineImgInterp
Image Interpolation mex file for matlab allowing 2nd to 9th order BSplines.

This is a simple wrapper use the excellent image interpolation code provided by P. Thevenaz on http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/interpolation/interpolation.html. The file BSplineImgInterp.c can be compiled using the matlab mex function to create the matlab function BSplineImgInterp.

The original author provides three versions of the code, one for MAC, Unix and PC. I've only tested the MAC version. BSplineImgInterp.c includes the code from the lib directory. This way, different versions can easily be interchanged by renaming lib_MAC, lib_UNIX or lib_PC to lib.

# Matlab usage:
  `g = ImgInterpBSpline(f,pos,SplineDegree,MirrorFlag,Tol)
 
  Inputs:\\
  f             : input image (single)\\
  pos           : [N x 2] list of interpolation coordinates (double)
  SplineDegree* : default=3, one of [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] (double)
  MirrorFlag*   : default=true, extrapolate outside of the image by mirroring
  Tol*          : default=1e-9, tolerance used when computing the coefficients
 
  Outputs:
  g            : interpolated values of f on pos (single)
  c*            : BSpline coefficient image (single)
 
  * in/outputs marked with an asterisk are optional`
